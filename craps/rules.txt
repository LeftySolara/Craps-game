Simple craps simulator

This program is meant to simulate the game of Craps in it's most basic form. Two dice will be rolled, and win/lose conditions will be checked.


The Rules:

    Each round is played by rolling two dice and reporting the result.

    First roll:
        - If roll is a 2, 3, or 12, you lose the round
        - If roll is a 7 or 11, you win the round
        - Any other roll is recorded and called your "point"

    Remaining rolls:
        - Continue to roll the dice until you
            a) roll your point
            b) roll a 7
        - If you roll your point, you win the round
        - If you roll a 7, you lose the round
