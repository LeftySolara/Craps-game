Craps Simulator


The Rules:

    Each round is played by rolling two dice and reporting the result.

    First roll:
        - If roll is a 2, 3, or 12, you lose the round
        - If roll is a 7 or 11, you win the round
        - Any other roll is recorded and called your "point"

    Remaining rolls:
        - Continue to roll the dice until you:
            a) roll your point
            b) roll a 7
        - If you roll your point, you win the round
        - If you roll a 7, you lose the round

Betting:

    Each game starts the player with $10,000. Before each round,
    the player will be asked to choose a bet type and amount. There
    are two types of bets: pass (player wins round) and no pass
    (player loses round). There is also an option to not place
    a bet at all for the round.
